            <h1>How Does Solar Work?</h1>
            <h3>Solar Energy Technologies</h3>
            <p>The amount of sunlight that strikes the earth's surface in an hour and a half is enough to handle the
                entire world's energy consumption for a full year. Solar technologies convert sunlight into electrical
                energy either through photovoltaic (PV) panels or through mirrors that concentrate solar radiation. This
                energy can be used to generate electricity or be stored in batteries or thermal storage.

                Below, you can find resources and information on the basics of solar radiation, photovoltaic and
                concentrating solar-thermal power technologies, electrical grid systems integration, and the
                non-hardware aspects (soft costs) of solar energy. You can also learn more about how to go solar and the
                solar energy industry. In addition, you can dive deeper into solar energy and learn about how the U.S.
                Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office is driving innovative research and development in
                these areas.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Solar Energy 101:</p>
                    Solar radiation is light – also known as electromagnetic radiation – that is emitted by the sun.
                    While every location on Earth receives some sunlight over a year, the amount of solar radiation that
                    reaches any one spot on the Earth’s surface varies. Solar technologies capture this radiation and
                    turn it into useful forms of energy.

                <li>
                    <p class="bold">Photovoltaics Basics:</p>
                    You're likely most familiar with PV, which is utilized in solar panels. When the sun shines onto a
                    solar panel, energy from the sunlight is absorbed by the PV cells in the panel. This energy creates
                    electrical charges that move in response to an internal electrical field in the cell, causing
                    electricity to flow.

                <li>
                    <p class="bold">Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power Basics:</p>
                    Concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP) systems use mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto
                    receivers that collect solar energy and convert it to heat, which can then be used to produce
                    electricity or stored for later use. It is used primarily in very large power plants.
